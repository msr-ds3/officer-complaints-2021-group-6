# officer-complaints-2021-group-6

### Sambhav Shrestha & Adina Scheinfeld

In this project, we replicated, analyzed and extended the results from the [article](https://github.com/msr-ds3/coursework/blob/master/week4/ft_police_complaints.pdf) published by Financial Times on May 28, 2021, one year after the death of George Floyd. This article analyzes the police complaints data from 3 big cities: New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago, and draw a distribution pointing out the top 10% of police officers with most complaints compromised a third of total complaints. 

The first part of our project was the replication part where we were able to replicate the graphs to almost the same. The second part of our project was focused on the extension of the article, by going deep dive into the datasets and looking for any kind of relationships. The extension of the article is deployed in the shiny web app.

You can view the results in the following links:
