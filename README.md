# officer-complaints-2021-group-6

### Sambhav Shrestha & Adina Scheinfeld

In this project, we replicated, analyzed, and extended the findings of the Financial Times [article](https://github.com/msr-ds3/coursework/blob/master/week4/ft_police_complaints.pdf) from May 28, 2021, one year after the death of George Floyd. The article analyzes data on complaints against police officers from 3 big cities: New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago, and draws a distribution which points out that the number of complaints filed against the 10% of police officers with the most complaints comprises a third of all the complaints that were filed. 

The first part of our project focused on understanding the datasets by replicating the graphs published in the article. The second part of our project focused on extending the analysis in the article by doing a deep dive into the datasets and researching other relationships withing the data. The extension of the article is deployed in the shiny web app.
