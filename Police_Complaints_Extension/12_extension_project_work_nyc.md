## "The Correlation Between Gender and Complaints Against Police Officers in NYC"

The purpose of this project was to analyze the correlation between the gender and complaints against NYC police officers. Analysis was done to compare the association between the gender of the impacted person, the gender of the offending officer, and whether impacted people of one gender were more likely to have "action" taken as a result of their complaints than people of the other gender. The category of "action" includes actions such as the officer being found guilty, the officer pleading guilty, nolo contendere, the officer being dismissed, the officer being retained with discipline, and the officer receiving training. The category of "no action" includes the officer being found not guilty, the officer being retained without discipline, and the charge being dismissed. Analysis was also done to determine whether there was a correlation between the sex of the offending officer and whether a complaint was sustained.  

All data used in this project was taken from the New York Civil Liberties Union. The data include incidents that occurred from 1985-2020. However, cases in which the outcome was not specified could not be used in this analysis.  Additionally, cases that were still pending or in which the officer retired before a resolution were not included in the analysis.
